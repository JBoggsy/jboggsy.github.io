                            I am an AI Research Scientist at the <a href="https://integratedcognition.ai/">Center for
                            Integrated Cognition</a>, where I work on merging modern computer vision models for object
                            detection, segmentation, and scene reconstruction with the Soar cognitive architecture, a
                            long-standing symbolic framework for intelligent agents. My research sits at the
                            intersection of perception and reasoning: how deep learning-based representations can be
                            harnessed to enrich symbolic cognition and enable agents to build internal world models,
                            ground their knowledge in multimodal experience, and act intelligently over the long term.

                            I recently completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of
                            Michigan, advised by <a href="https://laird.engin.umich.edu/">John Laird</a> in the Soar
                            Lab. My dissertation, *A Cognitive Architectural Approach to Visual-Symbolic Reasoning*,
                            explored how neuro-symbolic integration can expand the perceptual and reasoning capabilities
                            of cognitive architectures. Along the way, I taught foundational AI courses, mentored
                            motivated students, and discovered that teaching is one of the best ways to deepen your own
                            understanding.

                            I earned a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. in Philosophy from Union College in 2018.
                            During my undergrad, I worked in the Tensegrity Lab under <a
                            href="https://www.union.edu/computer-science/faculty-staff/john-rieffel">Dr. John
                            Rieffel</a>, where I researched learning gaits for tensegrity robots. I also interned at the
                            Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., where I worked on rebellious autonomous
                            agents.

                            My path into AI began less conventionally: as a high school student studying Latin, I wanted
                            to build a translator. That curiosity led me to Python, then NLTK, and eventually to the
                            broader field of AI. In college, I combined my interests in computer science and philosophy,
                            researching tensegrity robotics while also writing on the plausibility of consciousness in
                            artificial intelligences. Those early experiences cemented my fascination with intelligence
                            — both natural and artificial — and continue to shape my work today.

                            My goal is to uncover the principles of intelligence while applying them to real-world
                            problems, advancing both fundamental science and practical applications that benefit
                            humanity. I believe the next frontier in AI lies not in chasing full AGI immediately, but in
                            deepening AI’s understanding of the world through embodied, multimodal grounding and robust
                            internal world models. Thus I believe that LLMs, while incredibly powerful tools, are not
                            sufficient for achieving human-level performance in a wide variety of tasks, particularly in
                            embodied contexts.

                            Side note: I'm a big fan of em dashes — I have been since I wrote for the student newspaper
                            in undergrad — and I won't allow ChatGPT to make me give them up. Frankly, I think it's
                            indicative of the power of LLMs that they correctly identified the elegance and utility of
                            the em dash, a punctuation cleaner and sharper than parentheses.
